# Welcome to my GitHub! 🌙✨

Hi, I'm Eden (she/her) 🦇 tldr; I'm a senior machine learning engineer from the UK.

Currently I am very interested in scaling and productionising ML systems (MLOps), in particular for computer vision applications. My background is a mixture of computer vision, medical imaging, deep learning and psychology. I've also previously worked as a data scientist, and at a startup analysing super-resolution microscopy images. 🔬

In my spare time you can find me fawning over my pet tarantula Blueberry, training for my next pole dancing show, or drinking an unhealthy amount of bubble tea. 🧋
